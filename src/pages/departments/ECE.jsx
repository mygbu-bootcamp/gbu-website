      "Greeting from the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering!!",
      "I warmly welcome you to the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Gautam Buddha University. Over all these years, we have made progress in imparting technical education to our students and bringing them at par with the ever-expanding horizons of Electronics and Communication Engineering and its application areas. At the undergraduate level, we offer four-year B. Tech. Programme, and four-year B. Tech. (Engineering Design) Programme. At the postgraduate level, we offer three areas of specialization for two-year M. Tech. Programmes: (i) Wireless Communication and Networks, (ii) VLSI Design, (iii) Railway Signalling Telecommunication and RAMS. We also offer Ph.D. Programmes for full time and working professionals in all areas where research is being currently conducted by our faculty members.",
      "The Electronics and Communication Engineering department has always placed prime emphasis on excellence in teaching and research. Faculty members have very good academic credentials and are highly motivated towards imparting the best of education, as well as pioneering research and development. Our courses are frequently updated in terms of depth as well as the subjects themselves, so that our students always remain on the forefront of technological advancement. Well-equipped laboratories and encouragement to pursue research have increased our students’ productivity in terms of placements, higher studies, and research contributions. It has been observed that student research contribution has increased tremendously during the last few years. We regularly organize seminars, workshops, conferences, faculty development programmes, skill enhancement programmes, expert talks, invited lectures, etc., that benefit our students as well as the staff members of our school.",
